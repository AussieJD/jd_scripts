       README FILE IS PROVIDED FOR THE CONVINIENCE OF USERS WHO DO NOT HAVE
       HTML VIEWERS.


 WHAT IS SQUID-GRAPH?
 =====================

 Squid-Graph is a free, simple, but powerful Squid logfile analysis tool 
 distributed under the GNU General Public Licence. It generates reports which
 analyzes the traffic of a Squid proxy server in the form of graphs.



 SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
 ====================

 Squid-Graph is actively developed on a Linux machine running Perl 5 and
 2.2.x to 2.4.x kernel. It should work with most other similar operating
 systems.

 A few platforms which Squid-Graph have been reported to work with are
 FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Sun Solaris and various different Linux distributions.

 To use in Windows, you can obtain the Win32 port of PERL from ActiveState,
 and modify the code of this software, but we will not provide support for
 Windows-specific issues because we did not design this program to work with
 Windows.



 PRE-REQUISITES
 ===============

 You will need a working copy of PERL 5 and GD-1.3.3 installed.
 See http://search.cpan.org/dist/GD/ for latest GD version.

 GD _MUST_ be working, i.e. all its dependent libs must also be installed for
 Squid Graph v3 to work.

 ... and of course, you'll need a Squid proxy server.



 INSTALLING SQUID-GRAPH
 =======================

 Extract the tarball file squid-graph-x.x.tar.gz into a desired directory. To
 extract,

    Linux:
    $ tar -zxvf squid-graph-x.x.tar.gz

    Other UNIX:
    $ zcat squid-graph-x.x.tar.gz | tar xvf -


 Then, move the extracted contents to your desired directory. e.g.

    $ mv squid-graph-x.x /usr/local/squid-graph



 CONFIGURING SQUID-GRAPH
 ========================

 As of version 3.0, there aren't any more configuration files. For a list
 of configuration options, simply run squid-graph without any parameters.

    $ cd bin
    $ ./squid-graph


 FOR EXPERTS ONLY:

 For experts, you might want to configure some things like your graph colours
 or remove the console output messages. This can be done by editing the file
 `squid-graph', and then changing the $MYCONSOLELOG variable and the $color
 variables to your preferred values.

    $ vi squid-graph


 RUNNING SQUID-GRAPH
 ====================

 Quickstart:
 To run Squid Graph with the default settings, simply do this:

    $ cd bin
    $ ./squid-graph --output-dir=/tmp < /usr/local/squid/access.log


 However, you really won't want the reports to end up in /tmp, so you might
 want to specify another directory, for example: -
 
    $ ./squid-graph --output-dir=/var/www/html < /usr/local/squid...


 If you hate the annoying console ouput/logging, you can disable it
 by using the --no-console-log parameter, e.g.

   $ ./squid-graph --no-console-log --output-dir=/var/www/html...


 Advanced:
 If your cache only logs TCP or does not use the UDP at all, you can
 specify the --tcp-only option for tcp-only output. e.g.

   $ ./squid-graph --tcp-only --output-dir=/var/www/html...


 Likewise, if you would like to see only UDP reports,  you can specify
 the --udp-only option. e.g.

   $ ./squid-graph --udp-only --output-dir=/var/www/html...


 For more help on running Squid Graph, see the HTML documentation or
 the project website.



 RUNNING SQUID-GRAPH IN REAL TIME VIA THE WEB
 =============================================

 As of v3, Squid Graph does not support this feature anymore. If you would
 still like to do this, simply create a shell script to execute Squid
 Graph.

 We do not recommend this unless your log files are really small. Also,
 we did not audit Squid Graph for any possible security issues that might
 arise in an online CGI enviroment. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
